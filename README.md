# HAPI Server: API-first approach for Model Context Protocol

The HAPI server is a modern, API-first platform for building and exposing [headless APIs](/glossary#hapi---headless-api-stack-a-software-architecture-that-separates-the-business-logic-in-backend-services-from-the-client-layer-enabling-greater-flexibility-and-scalability). It is designed to work seamlessly with OpenAPI specifications, gRPC IDL, and the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling robust schema validation, dynamic routing, and secure integration for any context-driven application.

## What is the HAPI Server?

The HAPI Server is an implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that provides a standardized way to manage and interact with context-aware APIs. It allows developers to define, expose, and consume APIs that are sensitive to the context in which they are used, enabling more intelligent and adaptive applications.

HAPI stands for "Headless API" and emphasizes the separation of backend services from the client layer, allowing for greater flexibility and scalability in application development.

## Key Features

- **API-First Design**: HAPI is built around the OpenAPI specification, allowing developers to define their APIs in a standardized format that can be easily shared and understood.
- **Security**: HAPI includes built-in support for various authentication and authorization mechanisms, ensuring secure access to APIs.
- **Extensibility**: HAPI is designed to be extensible, allowing developers to add custom functionality and integrate with other systems as needed.
